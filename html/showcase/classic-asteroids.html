  <h1>{{ "title" }}</h1>

  <p>One of first hits of the arcade era was Atari’s Asteroids, and it is still one of the most well known games of all
    time. For this reason, I’ve decided to remake it in a web-based version.</p>

  <p>You can play the game <a href="/asteroids.html">here</a>. The arrow keys control the spaceship, <code>f</code> to shoot and <code>s</code>
    for shield.</p>

  <p>You can find the source code on github here: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/david-wiles/asteroids-ts">https://github.com/david-wiles/asteroids-ts</a>.
