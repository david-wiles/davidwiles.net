  <p>
    ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for visiting my website!
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a software engineer currently working with distributed systems, with full-stack experience. I've completed a
    Master's degree as well as a Bachelor's in Computer Science, which was more than enough school for me.

  <p>
    The goal of this website is to give me a way to record interesting things I've been learning about or working on.
    Hopefully you find some of it interesting!
