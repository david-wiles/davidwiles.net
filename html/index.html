    Thanks for visiting my website. There's not a lot of content here but maybe that'll change in the near future...

    I recently discovered Ben Stoke's <a target="_blank" href="https://tinyprojects.dev/">Tiny Projects Blog</a>, and I
    was inspired to pursue the same goals as his: finish a new tiny(ish) project every few weeks. Check out the <a
    href="/showcase/list.html">projects tab</a> to see what software projects I've been working on. The <a
    href="/blog/list.html">blog tab</a> has some articles about software engineering topics, and the <a
    href="/coffee/list.html">coffee tab</a> has some articles about what coffee I've been drinking.
